1. Compile and remove all the warnings
2. Find a solution on which queue to use in the graph (HL or FIFO), maybe by input?
3. Document algorithm running time - it might explain why dijkstra is much slower on larget graphs
4. Remove all comments labeled DEAD CODE
5. Note on the docuemnt that we tried using the STD priority queue and due to poor results we implemented our own
6. Decide on the structure of 'main'
7. Fix doxigen output
8. Arrange the input\output of the functions (prints)
9. Test on graphs from AC and GF
10. Make sure all debug levels print logical things
11. Fill the excel docuement with examples - create graph describing the results
12. Create a lot more graphs between 10x10 and 100x100 to check more results - Should be run at my computer, 
    i can send you the results
13. Change program paramaters section in our document
14. Add washington Wide and Long graphs and tests them
15. Test bigger AC graphs (maybe 100, 200, ...,1000)
16. Add finishing conclusions (summing up all the resluts from different graph types, node selection method and feature)
17. Add clocks per node graph maybe?
